    1. Explain, generally what is meant by a NoSQL database
 */
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
    NoSQL is an upcoming category of database management systems. It's main characteristics is its non-adherence to
    relational database concepts. NoSQL means "not only SQL".
    The concept of NoSQL databases grew with Internet giants, such as: Google, Amazon and Facebook who deal with
    gigantic volume of data. When you use the relational database for massive volume of data the system starts
    getting slow in terms of response time. To overcome this we could scale up our system by upgrading existing
    hardware. The alternative to this problem would be to distribute our database load on multiple hosts as the
    load increases - scale out.
    NoSQL is non relational database that scale out better than relational databases and are designed with web
    applications in mind, they do not use SQL to query data and do not follow the strict schemas like relational models.
    With NoSQL ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) features are not always guaranteed.
    NoSQL databases are sort of highly specialized systems and have their special usage and limitations. NoSQL suites
    more for those who handles huge volumes of data, the vast majority use relational databases and associated tools.
